"""Example LLM: a template for a local LLM add-on (docs/addons.md).

Everything Asterism knows about a local LLM is in this one file: how it is found (detect), what it
is called in agent settings (connect_key), and its engine: how it starts and stops, what its API
answers, how it keeps its models, and what the app's pages may do with them. The core asks the
engine and never names a local LLM, so nothing else changes when this add-on is switched on.

Copy the folder, rename the key ("examplellm") and the names, and keep only what differs from the
defaults in llm_engine.Engine (every fact and method there says its default). The built-in ones
(provider_llamacpp.py, provider_ollama.py, …) are add-ons made the same way.
tests/test_new_addon_end_to_end.py loads this folder as a signed add-on and checks it works.
